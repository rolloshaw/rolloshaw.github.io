        <p>Here's a bit about me.</p>
        
        <p>I'm working on a few new things from my base here in Barcelona and have a relatively broad set of interests.</p> 

        <ul>
            <li>Health & wellness: I'm a keen sportsman and am deeply interested in how our minds' work. At the moment, I am currently working on <a href="https://www.thepulsering.com">Pulse</a>.</li>
            <li>Consumer products (hard or soft): In a past life, I worked in a variety of roles (from finance to technology) at <a href="https://www.ab-inbev.com">AB InBev</a>. Now, I'm working on Pulse (see above).</li>
            <li>AI: I used to work at <a href="https://faculty.ai">Faculty</a> and now, at times, I work as an AI Consultant.</li>
            <li>Startups: I was on the early team at <a href="https://hackajob.com/">hackajob</a> and together we went through <a href="https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/london">Techstars London</a>.
        </ul>

        <p>Please get in contact if you want. My email is my first name plus my last name at Gmail.</p>
