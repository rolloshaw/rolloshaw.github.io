        <p>I've worked on a bunch of different projects in the AI space, mainly from a product management perspective. I worked on projects while at AB InBev, Faculty AI and also from a freelance / independent perspective. No doubt I'll work on more so I'll try to keep this page updated.</p>

        <p>These are listed below. At somepoint I'll likely add more context to this page.</p>
